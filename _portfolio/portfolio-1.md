title: "Computer Vision"

Computer Lab 1


The objective is to perform **Python-based image processing operations**, **image analysis** and **image filtering**. Basic **image I/O** functions include reading in images, saving images, resizing&croping images, displaying images. Image Processing operations include converting the colour image into **grayscale** channels, computing the **histograms** for the grayscale images, applying the **histogram equalisation** to the grayscale images, **image denoising via a Gaussian Filter**, implementing own 3x3 **Sobel filter** to perform **edge detection**, performing **forward/backward mapping** and **inverse warping** method i.e. **bilinear interpolation** to rotate images.
