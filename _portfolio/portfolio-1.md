The objective is to perform Python-based image processing operations**, image analysis and image filtering. Basic image I/O functions include reading in images, saving images, resizing&croping images, displaying images. Image Processing operations include converting the colour image into grayscale channels, computing the histograms for the grayscale images, applying the histogram equalisation to the grayscale images,
